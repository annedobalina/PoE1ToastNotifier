# PoE1ToastNotifier
Notifier for in game events for PoE 1 (reads client.txt file, should not break TOS)

This script reads the client.txt file for Path Of Exile 1 and will generate a Toast popup if certain events are triggered.

As it reads the client.txt file and does not interact with the game or game files in any way it does not break the TOS (or at least, according to many sources it doesn't).

Uses native windows libraries/functionality so no dependancies or extra installation required - you just need to be able to run powershell scripts.

I use this tool because I play a build with high visual clutter and have Global/Trade/Guild chat open (yes yes I know) and can't always see/read/tell when a the Reflecting Mist or Nameless Seer generates in the game.

This is a variation of scripts cobbled from https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1c7ynei/psa_hideout_farming_via_windows_powershell/ and other locations.

# Usage: 
You may have to disable windows DND settings for games

SETTINGS > SYSTEM > FOCUS ASSIST and then under Automatic Rules/When I'm Playing a Game.

Copy/Save the PoE1ToastNotifier.ps1 file somewhere.
If you want to have custom sounds play then use the PoE1NotifierWithSounds.ps1 file instead.
Edit the client.txt location (or sounds location if using the sound version) and save.

Right click and run in powershell.

This should not require admin privelages to run as it's using native Windows features.

Make sure you're running in Windowed Fullscreen.

# Extending Functionality:
The script has room for you to add your own trigger conditions, as long as they are written to the client.txt file.  

Eg, Want a notification when Eagon is near a Memory tear? You can add that but you'll need to find every variation of his voicelines that state he's found one (there are many).

Want to know when a certain Merc is around? Add their voicelines (or maybe their name) too (but remember to disable when you hire them or you'll get spammed).

I can't think of others :D
